h1. om (Optinionated Metadata)

A library to help you tame sprawling XML schemas like MODS.

OM allows you to define a “terminology” to ease translation between XML and ruby objects – you can query the xml for Nodes or node values without ever writing a line of XPath.

OM “terms” are ruby symbols you define (in the terminology) that map specific XML content into ruby object attributes.

h3. Solrizing Documents

The solrizer gem provides support for indexing XML documents into Solr based on OM Terminologies.  That process is documented in the "solrizer documentation":http://ci.projectblacklight.org/jenkins/job/solrizer/RB_VERSION=1.9.3/Documentation/file.SOLRIZING_OM_DOCUMENTS.html

h2. OM in the Wild

We have a page on the Hydra wiki with a list of OM Terminologies in active use: "OM Terminologies in the Wild":https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/OM+Terminologies+in+the+Wild
